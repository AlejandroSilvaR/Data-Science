# Probability:

In probability projects, a large amount of data is usually collected about a specific topic. With this, the aim is to find distribution functions that allow the probability of occurrence of an event or several of them to be approximated. With this data, relevant information is extracted for future decision-making regarding the combined probabilities of the events, seeking the best solution to a problem.
